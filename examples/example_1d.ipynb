    "# Examples of using GRLP\n",
    "\n",
    "GRLP is a model that solves for the long-profile evolution of a fluvial channel using a built-in semi-implicit solver. \n",
    "In particular, it simulates the evolution of a gravel-bed river that shapes its bed by eroding, transporting, and depositing sediments. \n",
    "The model takes a few basic inputs, and since the numerical solver has been set up implicitly, the model can take long timesteps while remaining stable. \n",
    "As its basic inputs, the model takes a sediment and water input, a spatial domain, an uplift or subsidence rate (or equivalently, other local source or sink of material), and a floodplain width, plus a slew of appropriate constants. \n",
    "The model can also replace some of these with a set of power-law scaling relationships between downstream distance and (1) valley width, (2) drainage area, and (3) discharge.\n",
    "If this approach is taken, it allows an analytical solution, assuming that these variables *actually* follow a power-law downstream. \n",
    "However, for the numerical solution, these can be an arbitrary functions up and downstream, instead of power laws. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Wickert & Schildgen (2019, ESurf)](https://esurf.copernicus.org/articles/7/17/2019/) describe the theory behind this model and the equations that are implemented numerically here.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will present an example where we compare the numerical solution with power-law functions for important variables to the corresponding analytical solution, which will demonstrate some basic outcomes and methods of interacting with the model. \n",
    "The very first thing to do is load the relevant libraries."
